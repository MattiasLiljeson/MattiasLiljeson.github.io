    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been part of some quite large game projects as a member of a group. The biggest and longest was a game project for six months were we started from scratch and built a modern 3D space shooter with fun gameplay (at least that&rsquo;s what I think ;&ndash;)) and quite some eye candy.</p>

<p>My main work on this project consisted of designing and implementing the data oriented architecture, which was heavily inspired by the Java <a href="http://gamadu.com/artemis/">Artemis game engine</a>. I also worked on input, the renderer and a scripting system to construct and initialize objects during runtime. The scripting system was quite a challenge as C++ doesn&rsquo;t have a reflection API.</p>

<p>Someday, not to far into the future, I will write a few blog posts about the game and it&rsquo;s construction. In the meantime you can fork the source code on <a href="https://github.com/MattiasLiljeson/Amalgamation">GitHub</a> and download a compiled executable from <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/amalgamation">IndieDB</a>.</p>
