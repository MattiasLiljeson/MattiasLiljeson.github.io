I'm a CompSci MSc student at Blekinge Institute of Technology. My interests are mainly in 3D realtime rendering, GPGPU and performance. I do enjoy making games too :-)

In my free time I'm Scout Leader in a local Sea Scout Group and enjoy sailing, hiking, skiing and rock climbing.

My main experience is in C++ and Java. I have some experience with other languages as well (this site is for example built with ruby). If you want to read about the projects I've done, please look at the portfolio page. If you want to take a look at and fork my code please visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/MattiasLiljeson). Happy Hacking!
