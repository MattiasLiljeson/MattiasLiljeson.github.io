My main work on this project consisted of designing and implementing the data driven architecture, which was heavily inspired by the Java [Artemis game engine](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). I also worked on input, the renderer and a scripting system to construct and initialize objects during runtime. The scripting system was quite a challenge as C++ doesn't have a reflection API. 

Someday, not to far into the future, I will write a few blog posts about the game and it's construction. In the meantime you can fork the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MattiasLiljeson/Amalgamation) and download a compiled executable from [IndieDB](http://www.indiedb.com/games/amalgamation).
