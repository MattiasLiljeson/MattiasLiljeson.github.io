My main experience is from game projects were I've mostly worked on architecture and rendering. I do however have other interests as well. Some of these ramblings are presented below.

### Amalgamation

I've been part of some quite large game projects as a member of a group. The biggest and longest was a game project for six months were we started from scratch and built a modern 3D space shooter with fun gameplay (at least that's what I think ;-)) and quite some eye candy.

### The little cheese boy

In the autumn of 2012, together with some friends, I made a small pac-man clone with a twist in a project course. The goal with this project was to get a grip on Agile methodologies, especially Scrum, and to successfully deliver a cross-platform game. In the end, I think we got a cute little game together which the "client" (a prof. acting client) seemed to like a lot.

### The Makes-a-Click editor

A short interface project with focus on usability. Our idea was to create and editor where all the editing was done using a gamepad. Therefore, the editor could be used by users who can't use a standard mouse and keyboard, e.g. due to a physical disability. Small scale usability testing was done and a short report regarding it's effectiveness was written. The conclusion drawn was that the editor was a fast tool but lacked in precision which is in line with other usability research focused on joystick/thumbstick performance.

### Artificial Life simulation

Back in 2012, I did my first foray into clean code after having watched some of Uncle Bob's web lectures on vimeo. I was pretty happy with what it turned out to and later did some optimizations when publishing the code a year later. I wrote a blog post about it

A small game I did in 10 hours using Game Maker for the Ludum Dare 25 Game Jam. Placed #25 in the humor category out of 1327 entries. A download link as well as the source can be fetched from the [Ludum Dare entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/comment-page-1/?action=preview&uid=19413)
